## About:
This repository aims to implement LSTM neural networks into predicting future stock prices, and business growth. This repository not only represents a successful tool for businesses, but also a bright investing partner for individual investors. While utilizing short and long term interactions this project can be successfully implemented. To conclude, this project streamlines trading for everyone, it provides a tool for everyone to become a professional trader without any background skills required.

## Problem Statement:
While this project is also aimed for professionals, the main goal is to make trading successful for everyone. It is to provide an accessible tool for anyone to become a trader and get enhanced revenue. It is to give everyone the required tools to succeed in the stock market, while leveraging advanced AI tools. This model represents a new intelligent tool for financial interactions.

## Used Concepts:
While explaining the complex and intricate architecture of this AI machine would take a whole research paper, here is a streamlined explanation. First of all, this financial model uses a tool called LSTM, this is a type of neural network. In essence a neural network learns from the mistakes while utilizing backpropagation, calculus, and partial derivatives within the learning process. This way it can update the parameters to achieve more accurate results. Despite the fact, this would represent a simple feed forward neural network, an LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network. Subsequently, it recurs through the data. Although, an LSTM differs from a recurrent neural network by avoiding vanishing/exploding gradients and by also maintaining a long term interaction to the data. This way it can produce more accurate predictions. Find some diagrams below:

## Accessing Information:
This AI machine will be accessible for both developers, traders, and businesses. Individual traders will obtain access to our AI machine through our simple streamlined web application, while businesses or large enterprises will get access to our models through personalized plans coordinated directly by our team. Finally, developers will get access to our technology through our API interaction. This way, we can develop a diverse technology accessible and personalized to everyones professional necessities.

## Disclaimer:
While this machine does use proved mathematical formulas and algorithms, it does not provide guaranteed predictions, it simply learns based on passed events to provide future mathematical based predictions. Subsequently, it does not take real world considerations into account. In conclusion, while this project articulates a strong machine learning model it is always important to verify financial decisions, and not to entirely rely on the model.
